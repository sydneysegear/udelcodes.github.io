<p> We're so glad you're here, and we're so excited to teach you guys some new and exciting things, and we hope you're excited to learn!</p>
<h2> Why learn to code? </h2>
There are so many reasons to learn to code, here's just a few: 
<ul>
  <li>It's fun!</li>
  <li>It can help you solve some of the world's biggest problems</li>
  <li>Gain a better understanding of the world around you</li>
  <li>Have more career choices in the future</li>
  <li>You can create and build nearly anything you can imagine</li>
</ul>
Let's get started! 
<h2>Build your own website!</h2>

<h3>HTML</h3>
First, we'll learn about HTML so you can build your very own website!

#### Before we begin learning, let's check out some other websites and look at their HTML. 

Right click anywhere on this page and click the button that says "view page source". This should open up another page, which will contain all of the HTML used to build this website. You can do this for any website on the internet!

Look through the HTML. See if you can find places where it says 

- div

-input

-class

-id

-li

Once you've found some of those items, <a href="https://udel.codes/LTC/introtohtml/index.html" target="_blank" >click here</a> to start learning how to write HTML code!

#### Things to add to YOUR index.html
<div>
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Change the title of your page (found in the head) to say "Your name's Website"</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change the author (also found in the head) to be your name</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change the header of your webpage to say "Your name's Favorite Things About Summer"</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Add a link that links back to http://www.udel.codes/LTC</label><br> 
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Add some items to your list of favorite summer activities</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Add some things to your summer to do list</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Change one of the lists to be an ordered list</label><br> 
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Add a photo to your website!</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Add a paragraph element and write about your favorite summer memory</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
    <label><em>CHALLENGE TASK </em>Create a list of things you want to do this summer and add checkboxes next to each item! (Pssst look at this page's source code for a hint!)</label><br>  
</div><br>

Now that you've add all of this cool content, let's add some color and style to it! We'll do this using **CSS**!

<h3>CSS</h3>
Want to add some <i>style</i>??? Click <a href="./introtocss/index.html" target="_blank" >here</a> to learn about CSS!<br>

Another important concept in CSS is the use of *selectors*, which allow the programmer to choose which items they want to apply CSS to. 

A very helpful (and fun!) game to play to learn more about selectors is the CSS Diner Game found [here](https://flukeout.github.io/).

Try adding some CSS to your glitch website! Go into the file called "style.css" on the left side of the screen and begin adding your CSS there!

Try these tasks:

<input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change Background Color</label><br>
<input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change Text Color</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label>Change the font</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label>Change Header Color</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label><em>CHALLENGE TASK</em> Change the background to be a gradient (google "Gradient background CSS")</label><br>
