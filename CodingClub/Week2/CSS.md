<h3>CSS</h3>
Want to add some <i>style</i>??? Click <a href="./introtocss/index.html" target="_blank" >here</a> to learn about CSS!<br>

Another important concept in CSS is the use of *selectors*, which allow the programmer to choose which items they want to apply CSS to. 

A very helpful (and fun!) game to play to learn more about selectors is the CSS Diner Game found [here](https://flukeout.github.io/).

Try adding some CSS to your codepen website! Go to the section called "CSS" in the middle of the screen and begin adding your CSS there!

Try these tasks:

<input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change Background Color</label><br>
<input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change Text Color</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label>Change the font</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label>Change Header Color</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label><em>CHALLENGE TASK</em> Change the background to be a gradient (google "Gradient background CSS")</label><br>
