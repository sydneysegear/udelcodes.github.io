Now that you've add all of this cool content, let's add some color and style to it! We'll do this using **CSS**!

<h3>CSS</h3>
Want to add some <i>style</i>??? Click <a href="./introtocss/index.html" target="_blank" >here</a> to learn about CSS!<br>

Another important concept in CSS is the use of *selectors*, which allow the programmer to choose which items they want to apply CSS to. 

A very helpful (and fun!) game to play to learn more about selectors is the CSS Diner Game found [here](https://flukeout.github.io/).

Try adding some CSS to your glitch website! Go into the file called "style.css" on the left side of the screen and begin adding your CSS there!
