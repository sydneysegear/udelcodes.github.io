### Quick Recap

So far, we have learned about HTML and how to put words and images on our websites. We have started to create our own websites!  
Now that you've added all of this cool content, let's add some color and style to it! We'll do this using **CSS**!

### CSS

CSS is all about making websites look pretty. We use CSS to add colors, change font types and sizes, and edit the margins.  
Let's check out this <a href="https://udel.codes/LTC/introtocss/index.html" target="_blank" >CSS tutorial</a> to learn about CSS!<br>

### Selectors

Another important concept in CSS is the use of *selectors*, which allow the programmer to choose which items they want to apply CSS to. 

A very helpful (and fun!) game to play to learn more about selectors is the CSS Diner Game found [here](https://flukeout.github.io/).

### Ready to Code?

Try adding some CSS to your codepen website! Go to the section called "CSS" in the middle of the screen and begin adding your CSS there!

Try these tasks:

<input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change Background Color</label><br>
<input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change Text Color</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label>Change the font</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label>Change Header Color</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label><em>CHALLENGE TASK</em> Change the background to be a gradient (google "Gradient background CSS")</label><br>
