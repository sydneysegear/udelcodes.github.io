## Weakly Tactial Meetings: Thursday 8pm
You can find the zoom link for the meetings on our slack channel.

## Teacher Training
**ALL TEACHERS MUST FILL OUT CLEARENCE FORMS!** If you do not, you will not be able to join us on our first field trip. Below is information we discussed at
our teacher training tactical meeting. 

### Getting Started...
1. Say hello, encourage the students to turn their cameras on if they are willing.
2. Introduce yourself! They see you as a big scary college student, an introduction can make them feel more comfortable with you.
3. Send them to our homepage udel.codes
4. Let them play with the embedded game on the website
5 .Have them open the example codepen
6 .Have them make Codepen accounts
7. Fork it!!! They will have trouble finding the button, they won’t know what you’re talking about, they will not speak up and tell you that they didn’t fork it because they don’t know how

**Enable multiple participants screen sharing**

**Ask them to share their screen while they work so you can help them better**


### Run-Through the code
1. Ask them to look through the code for words they might recognize.
2. Show them the format of the JSON object
3. Explain difference between the object name and the display name
4. Show where the combinations go (Show that combinations go under both objects, not just one of them)

### Common Issues
- They don’t understand the importance of case sensitivity
- They forget quotes around object names
- They forget commas anywhere (At the end of a line, At the end of a json object)
- They don’t change the object ID name from “Example 1”
- They use the display name instead of the object name
- Image errors (They forget quotes around an image url, Bad link, Copied image link instead of address)

### Remind them…
- Save their code often!
- Pay attention for a red exclamation point in the bottom right corner
- Make sure they forked the code
