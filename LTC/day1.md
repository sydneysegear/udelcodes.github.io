<p> We're so glad you're here, and we're so excited to teach you guys some new and exciting things, and we hope you're excited to learn!</p>
<h2> Why learn to code? </h2>
There are so many reasons to learn to code, here's just a few: 
<ul>
  <li>It's fun!</li>
  <li>It can help you solve some of the world's biggest problems</li>
  <li>Gain a better understanding of the world around you</li>
  <li>Have more career choices in the future</li>
  <li>You can create and build nearly anything you can imagine</li>
</ul>
Let's get started! 
<h2>Build your own website!</h2>

<h3> 1. Make a Glitch.com account (if you want to) </h3>

Before we start, open up <a href="https://glitch.com" target="_blank">glitch.com</a>. You don't need to make an account to do today's activity, but if you want to save your work for longer than 5 days, you'll need to make an account. 

To make an account on Glitch, press the "Sign in" button in the upper right, then click "Create an Account". If you have a G-Mail, Facebook, or GitHub account, you can sign in with those, or you can just use your regular email.

If you sign in with your email, you might have to verify your account through an email that Glitch sends you.

<h3>HTML</h3>
First, we'll learn about HTML so you can build your very own website!

#### Before we begin learning, let's check out some other websites and look at their HTML. 

Right click anywhere on this page and click the button that says "view page source". This should open up another page, which will contain all of the HTML used to build this website. You can do this for any website on the internet!

Look through the HTML. See if you can find places where it says 

- div
-input
-class
-id
-li

Once you've found some of those items, <a href="./introtohtml/index.html" target="_blank" >click here</a> to start learning how to write HTML code!

<h3> 2. Make a new Glitch project </h3>

1. On the homepage of [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com), click the button that says "New Project" and then click "hello-webpage"

2. Once the project loads, go into the file that says "index.html". Remove all of the code that's in that file now and replace it with the code from <a href="./template.txt" target="_blank">this template</a>.

3. Press the button that says "Show" and then click either "In a New Window" or "Next to the Code". Now you can see your very own website/share it with others!

3. Spice up the code! Add whatever you like to it! We've created a few tasks below to get you started.


#### Things to add to YOUR index.html
<div>
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Change the title of your page (found in the head) to say "Your name's Website"</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change the author (also found in the head) to be your name</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change the header of your webpage to say "Your name's Favorite Things About Summer"</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Add a link that links back to http://www.udel.codes/LTC</label><br> 
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Add some items to your list of favorite summer activities</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Add some things to your summer to do list</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Change one of the lists to be an ordered list</label><br> 
  <input type="checkbox">
  <label>Add a photo to your website!</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Add a paragraph element and write about your favorite summer memory</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
    <label><em>CHALLENGE TASK</em>Create a list of things you want to do this summer and add checkboxes next to each item! (Pssst look at this pages source code for a hint!)</label><br>  
</div>

Now that you've add all of this cool content, let's add some color and style to it! We'll do this using **CSS**!

<h3>CSS</h3>
Want to add some <i>style</i>??? Click <a href="./introtocss/index.html" target="_blank" >here</a> to learn about CSS!<br>

Another important concept in CSS is the use of *selectors*, which allow the programmer to choose which items they want to apply CSS to. A very helpful (and fun!) game to play to learn more about selectors is the CSS Diner Game found [here](https://flukeout.github.io/).

Try adding some CSS to your glitch website!

Try these tasks:

<input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change Background Color</label><br>
<input type="checkbox" >
  <label>Change Text Color</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label>Change the font</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label>Change Header Color</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" >
<label><em>CHALLENGE TASK</em>Change the background to be a gradient (google "Gradient background CSS")</label><br>
