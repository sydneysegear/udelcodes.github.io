Let's play this for a second.

<p class="codepen" data-height="765" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="AndyNovo" data-slug-hash="zYrYPpR" style="height: 765px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Build Your Own &amp;quot;Choose Your Own&amp;quot; Adventure Game">

Now let's look at the source.

## Task 1:  Copy Paste

Click FORK to make start your own game.

Let's add a new major to our University choose your own adventure game by copying line 54 (starts with COPY FROM HERE) to line 77 (ends with END COPY HERE)

Change "startLocation" to "education" 

and ADD one option at line 70, `{buttonText:"Click here to major in Education", 
           takesYouToLocation:"education"}`
           
If it worked you'll see three buttons when you begin and if you click "Click here to major in Education" you'll see the old start image.

When we're done today you'll understand how this game is designed, build your own creative story, and learn how to make websites truly interactive.
