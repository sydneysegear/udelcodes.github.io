# You've made it to the end of camp!
---------
Congratulations on making it *all* the way to day 4 of Learn To Code camp! We hope you guys all learned a lot about web development and JavaScript during your time here, but the fun isn't over yet!

Today, we're going to finish that super cool *surprise* that we started yesterday, we're going to make our own online "Mad-Libs" game, and we're going to put everything together on the webpage that we built on Monday.

# Surpise App 

Since we received requests for this project to be on Codepen *and* Glitch, we're going to show you how to do it on both! It's *essentially* the same app on platforms, with the only difference being that all of the messages you send will be saved forever if you use **Codepen** (they'll be deleted once you exit the app if you're using Glitch).


## Instructions to Build The Surprise on Codepen

### Step 1. Fork the Codepen below

Open up <a href="https://codepen.io/dianevinson/pen/mdVOxVZ" target="_blank">this codepen</a> and click "fork" in the bottom right. That will create a new database for you to use which will store all of the messages you send.

### Step 2. Add the following code to the HTML tab

Paste the following HTML code into the HTML tab on the Codepen that you just forked.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/dianevinson/73bc69c5e7ffa3db053b0f85b6643068.js"></script>


### Step 3. Add the following CSS code

Copy and paste the following CSS code into the CSS tab on the Codepen that you just forked.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/dianevinson/a3c1e3b2ebc06a9c8ffd2e4d3aef3e5d.js"></script>


### Step 4. Add JavaScript 

Add the following JavaScript to line 36 in the JavaScript tab on your codepen. (Place this code below everything that's already in the JS tab).


<script src="https://gist.github.com/dianevinson/e06d866d7422262625c94d4b73687197.js"></script>

And there you have it! A beautiful chat app that stores all of your messages!

If you click "Change View" and then "Full Page View" on Codepen your chat app will take up the whole screen. 

You can share the link to your chat app with your friends and family and you guys can all communicate with each other!
