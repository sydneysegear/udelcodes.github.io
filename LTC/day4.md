# You've made it to the end of camp!
---------
Congratulations on making it *all* the way to day 4 of Learn To Code camp! We hope you guys all learned a lot about web development and JavaScript during your time here, but the fun isn't over yet!

Today, we're going to finish that super cool *surprise* that we started yesterday, we're going to make our own online "Mad-Libs" game, and we're going to put everything together on the webpage that we built on Monday.

# Surpise App 

Since we received requests for this project to be on Codepen *and* Glitch, we're going to show you how to do it on both! It's *essentially* the same app on platforms, with the only difference being that all of the messages you send will be saved forever if you use **Codepen** (they'll be deleted once you exit the app if you're using Glitch).


## Instructions to Build The Surprise on Codepen

### Step 1. Fork the Codepen below

Open up <a href="https://codepen.io/dianevinson/pen/mdVOxVZ" target="_blank">this codepen</a> and click "fork" in the bottom right. That will create a new database for you to use which will store all of the messages you send.

### Step 2. Add the following code to the HTML tab

Paste the following HTML code into the HTML tab on the Codepen that you just forked.
