Welcome to Fun with Cryptography!! We are so excited to have you here and to teach you all about crypto! And remeber, all of our material that we cover this week will be available on **THIS** website, so you can come back to it whenever you'd like.

## Who Are We?

We are the [CyberSecurity Scholars](https://www.udel.edu/apply/undergraduate-admissions/enrichment-opportunities/cybersecurity-scholars/) from the University of Delaware. 
This week's lesson was created by Nikki Pilla, Peter Haushalter, and Sophia Smith, 
along with help from other members of the CyberSecurity Scholars community.

## What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is the breaking and creating of secret codes.
Spies use cryptography to keep national secrets safe!  
You can think of it sort of like passing secrete notes that you can 
only understand if you know the secret language.  
In cybersecurity, it's used to keep your data safe and secure.  
Every bug company uses cryptography to protect data, from Facebook to Amazon to Google.  
Even small businesses use cryptography.

## Cybersecurity and Cryptography

Cryptography is a pillar to Cybersecurity. Without secret codes to keep your data private, 
there would be no cybersecurity.  
Ciphers are one method used in cryptography (we will be focusing on ciphers).  
Hashes are another method in cryptography.  
Without Cryptography there would be no internet, since the world runs on secret codes!  

## Jobs 

There are many jobs that ***YOU*** could get with knowledge of cryptography.  
Government Law Enforcement agencies are very interested in cryptography for two reasons: 
to protect their own information and secrets, 
and to uncover other secret information like foreign secrets.  
Most businesses are also interested in cryptography because they need to protect their own data, 
their employees' data, and their customers' data.  
Here are just a *few* potential jobs that relate to cryptography:

- Working for the NSA  
- Working for the Police or other government agencies  
- Working for companies to keep their data secure
- Working for companies to delevop secure software
