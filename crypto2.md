Today we will be switching from pen and paper to digital.  
Specifically, we will be focusing on converting letters and messages into numbers, randomness, and pseudo-randomness.

## Wacky Encryption

First, let's check out this [Wacky Encryption](https://codepen.io/AndyNovo/full/jOWqrYQ) made by our awesome professor Dr. Andy Novocin.  
Click on the link above and it will open a webapp that lets you encode messages based on a specific starting seed, or a starting number.  
 - Try to write a secret message. See what happens to the message as you change the seed.  
 - Now write a secret message and send it in the chat. Don't forget to include the seed or we won't be able to decode your message!  
 - Now try writing a secret message with a seed of 1 and then with a seed of 1025.
  What do you notice? What could this observation mean?  
  Think back to the first week of camp, Learn to Code, when we learned about for loops. 
  How could you use a for loop to help you crack this code if you didn't know the seed?

## CyberChef, a Crypto Super Toolbox

Head to the [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) website by clicking on that link.  
If you are following along with this lesson on your own, it may be helpful to check out [this reference](https://udel.codes/cyberchef) for how to use Cyberchef.  
CyberChef is so useful in cryptography! If we're spies, then CyberChef is our spy kit.  
It can encode and decode messages crazy fast, and all we have to do is tell it which kind of cipher to use.  
CyberChef is so smart, sometimes it can even guess which cipher it needs to decode a message without you telling it!
