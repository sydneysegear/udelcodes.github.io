## W3lc0m3 t0 Day 3 of Crypt0 W33k!!

This is my reminder to make a crossword puzzle for day 3.

## The CRABS Won the Lottery!!

The CRABS used their time-cycles to go back in time and buy a winning lottery ticket. 
They earned $51M last night in the New Jersey Powerball! 
To make matters worse, they are *determined* to soend all of it cracking our encryption schemes.  

## XOR Fun

With the CRABS spending $51M to crack our encryptions, the stakes are high. 
We have to get really good at encrypting our data. 
If we want to keep our data safe, we're going to have to use XOR. 
Head to this [XOR learnification.fun module](https://learnification.fun/module/xorrox) to learn all about XOR so we can keep our data safe from the CRABS!
