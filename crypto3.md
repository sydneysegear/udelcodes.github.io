## W3lc0m3 t0 Day 3 of Crypt0 W33k!!

This is my reminder to make a crossword puzzle for day 3.

## The CRABS Won the Lottery!!

The CRABS used their time-cycles to go back in time and buy a winning lottery ticket. 
They earned $51M last night in the New Jersey Powerball! 
To make matters worse, they are *determined* to soend all of it cracking our encryption schemes.  

## XOR Fun

With the CRABS spending $51M to crack our encryptions, the stakes are high. 
We have to get really good at encrypting our data. 
If we want to keep our data safe, we're going to have to use XOR. 
Head to this [XOR learnification.fun module](https://learnification.fun/module/xorrox) to learn all about XOR so we can keep our data safe from the CRABS!

## Diffie-Hellman

Real crypto is based on being able to communicate seret data across a public area. 
XOR allows us to randomize data and make it secret so that you can only decrypt it with a specific key. 
If two people are communicating with each other, then we want them both to know the secret key, but we don't want anyone else to know the secret key. 
We do this by using XOR and something called the Diffie-Hellman Secret Key Exchange.

The Diffie-Hellman method takes advantage of XOR in order to create a shared secret key between two people. 

## XOR and AES to Make Real Crypto

Like we said earlier, real crypto is based on being able to communicate seret data across a public area. Diffie-Hellman and XOR allow us have a shared secret key between two people, even in a public area. If we combine that with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), then we can actually send and receive secure messages in a public area.

Head to this [AES learnification.fun module](https://learnification.fun/module/aes) to practice this concept.
