We hope you enjoyed your first week of learning how to code, and if you are just joining us, welcome!

This week you will be learning the basic understandings of cybersecurity, and how you yourself can practice basic
network saftey when using your computer.

Throughout the week, we will be learning the ways of the Cyber House. The Cyber House is a group of cybersecurity
experts who will help us practice and learn cyber skills! We will also be helping them shutdown a group of hackers
who have been causing mayhem to the Cyber House. Lets introduce you to the agents you will be working with!
