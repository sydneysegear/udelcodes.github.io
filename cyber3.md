# Welcome to Cyber Week Day 3!

Alice and Bob are so happy that you have returned for another day of training, and are very impressed with
the Bash skills you learned yesterday.

We have been informed that you have found a secret message in their bash tutorial. Alice and Bob belive 
that this message can be used in the future to help against the L33k3rs!

If you remember from yesterday, the L33k3rs have infiltrated the **Global Dessert Database**. Alice and Bob still need your
help in figuring out how the L33k3rs managed to make our beloved database look like this!

Alice and Bob have managed to contact the developers of the Vault to get any information that may help us in solving this mystery.

## Web infiltration Mission

The **Global Dessert Vault** developers have provided us with a sample copy of their website. They suspect that an old, 
unprotected file upload page is the culprit, but they can't figure out how the l33k3rs managed to use the page to deface the main website. 

Take a look and see what you and the rest of the team can learn from the file upload page <a href="http://desserts.gel.webfactional.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Here is a link to the page that may be helpful in your mission to find out how the L33k3rs l33ked our page! Good Luck!
