Alice and Bob are so happy that you have returned for another day of training, and are very impressed with
the Bash skills you learned yesterday.

We have been informed that you have found a secret message in their bash tutorial. Alice and Bob belive 
that this message can be used in the future to help against the L33k3rs!

If you remember from yesterday, the L33k3rs have infiltrated the **Global Dessert Database**. Alice and Bob still need your
help in figuring out how the L33k3rs managed to make our beloved database look like this!

Alice and Bob have managed to contact the developers of the Vault to get any information that may help us in solving this mystery. 


## Web infiltration Mission

The **Global Dessert Vault** developers have provided us with a sample copy of their website. They suspect that an old, 
unprotected file upload page is the culprit, but they can't figure out how the l33k3rs managed to use the page to deface the main website. 

### Also, the developers of the Global Dessert Vault suspect that the L33k3rs have planted **nano bots in the website!** 

These nano bots
are believed to watch over the database, so when ever a new dessert recipe is entered into the database, they can steal it from us
and report it back to the L33k3rs! So it is a **HIGH PRIORITY** to figure out how the nano bots were planted!

Alright, not it is time for us to go to the sample copy of the database that the Dessert Vault developers have given us. 
Lets use this tool to solve this L33k3r problem! <a href="http://desserts.gel.webfactional.com/" target="_blank">Go TO THE DATABASE HERE</a>.

Here is a link to the page that may be helpful in your mission to find out how the L33k3rs l33ked our page! Good Luck!
