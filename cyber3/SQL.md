# L33k3r Database

## Help is greatly needed!

We have recently come into the possession of a Database created by the L33k3rs. This database contains information
on all of the agents involved in the L33k3er Orginization. Accessing this kind of information would be
a huge win for the Cyber House in their battle against the L33k3ers.

Alice and Bob believe they have found a way to enter this database and they are prepared to brief you
on their knowledge.

## SQL Injection

Alice and Bob belive that the database can be breached by a means of SQL Injection. Meaning they have 
found that the database the L33k3rs are using SQL, which is a popular language used to 
access and manage information held in a database management system. 

SQL Injection is the idea to convince the application to run SQL code that was not intended, therefore
we can access data the application does not want us to. Basically hacking the application!

## Unsanitized Input

Alice and Bob have provided us with documentation on SQL Injection which should help us infiltrate the
L33k3rs database.
