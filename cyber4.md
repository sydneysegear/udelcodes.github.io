Today is the last day of Cybersecurity week. Alice and Bob are pleased with how far you have come in your learnings
and how you have helped the Cyber House in their epic battle against the L33k3rs.

Yesterday you helped the Cyber House achieve a major accomplishment. Alice and Bob, thanks to you, were able to obtain 
information on all member of the L33k3rs. As we speak, Cyber House agents are tracking these people down to put
an end to their l33king schemes
