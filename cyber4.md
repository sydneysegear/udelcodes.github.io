Today is the last day of Cybersecurity week. Alice and Bob are pleased with how far you have come in your learnings
and how you have helped the Cyber House in their epic battle against the L33k3rs.

Yesterday you helped the Cyber House achieve a major accomplishment. Alice and Bob, thanks to you, were able to obtain 
information on all member of the L33k3rs. As we speak, Cyber House agents are tracking these people down to put
an end to their l33king schemes

Our battle against the L33k3rs is coming to a close, however there is still one thing left to do.

### The Nano Bots!

We still have to shut down the nano bots. The nano bots are sitll in the Global Dessert Vault sending recipes to the L33k3rs. In order to stop them, we need being to understand a very important programming language. **Assembly Language.**

# Assembly Language

Assembly Language is the original true low-level computer language with pure instructions that directly translate into machine code.

*To explain:*

- There are languages that are considered **High-Level Programming Langauges**, these languages include Python, Java, Javascript, Scratch, ect. These programming languages are then broken down to a **Lower-level Programing Language**

- **Low-Level Programming Languages**, like Assembly and Machine Code, communicate more directly with the computer. Meaning they are more closely related to the computer's core language, like binary. (1's and 0's)

*So why have High-Level Languages if they are just turned into a Low-Level Language?*

- This is because Low-Level Languages is difficult to use and harder to understand then High-Level Languages. High-Level Languages are much more easier to read, write, and maintain. If you think coding in general is hard, Assembly is that much harder.
