No... not that kind of fishing. But it's similar! "Phishers" or "Social Engineers" will put out some bait, and they're counting on you to bite it in order to be effective. We'll train you on how to spot their "bait", so that you never get reeled into a cyber scam!

Alice and Bob have intel that the L33k3rs have been messaging some of our agents to try to trick them into giving away personal information! 

<h2> So what is Phishing? </h2>

<b>Phishing</b> is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. 

<b>Some common characteristics of a Phishing Email:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Pretending to be someone you know </li>
  <li> Request sensitive information </li>
  <li> Use illegitimate domain names </li>
  <li> Bad spelling </li>
  <li> Include Attachments that you didn't ask for </li>
  </ul>
