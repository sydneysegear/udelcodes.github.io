## ACTIVITY 1: Now we will try to talk to each other using morse(-like) code! Yay so fun!!

Our version of Morse code:

** Heart language game
--> Insert streaming instructions for minecraft here

** Develop our own script for the minecraft people / talk them through it and demonstrate example

<h3> Now Imagine Multiple People Want to Talk at the Same Time </h3>

Aloha Net was based in Hawaii where they had to communicate between islands. The Aloha Net Protocol was developed so people could
communicate from two different islands without being interrupted by someone else.

** Radio Example

<h3> Noisy Channel </h3>


<h3> Now let's all try to make our own protocol for the noisy channel! </h3>

<h3> Let's go back to minecraft and see if our protocol works there too! </h3>
