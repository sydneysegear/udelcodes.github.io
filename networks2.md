## Crossword with terms for the internet

## Recap: the CONCEPT game in hearts was a "protocol"
 
It had a "header" (row and column) and a "payload" (picture ID).  Our beacon was a protocol too, including how we send.

## Travel analogy for OSI 7 layers

Each layer has it's own culture.

## Physical Layer

Buzzing the wire is our beacon, likewise fiber-optic is similar, but Radio (wi-fi) is different.

### The Noisy Channel

Let's try to play 20 questions between pairs of people between the two teams (5-6 games at once) using the noisy channel, and develop some labelling conventions to help us.

### ALOHAnet

Let's play the ALOHAnet demo to get a feel for exponential back-off (I'll try to make messages blurred if they collide).

## Examine Wireshark to see the layers

Notice how CONCEPT with hearts was "envelopes" inside of "boxes", and the internet puts those "boxes" into "carts" that go into "trucks", etc. We saw the same concept show up in week 1 and week 3 (IV vs ct, head vs body).

## Top-level applications

HTTP and SSH (Web Requests) vs bottom layer Wi-fi and Ethernet (MAC addresses), look at some log files.
